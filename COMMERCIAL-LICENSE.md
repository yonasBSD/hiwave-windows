# Commercial License

## Overview

HiWave is dual-licensed:

1. **Open Source License:** [Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)](LICENSE)
2. **Commercial License:** Described in this document

You may choose either license depending on your needs.

## When You Need a Commercial License

The MPL-2.0 open source license is suitable for most users. However, you need a commercial license if:

- **You modify HiWave's source files** and want to keep those modifications proprietary (MPL-2.0 requires sharing modifications to MPL-licensed files)
- **Your organization's policies** prohibit use of copyleft-licensed software
- **You want dedicated support** and a direct relationship with the HiWave team
- **You need custom terms** such as indemnification, warranty, or SLA guarantees
- **You're embedding HiWave** in a commercial product and need flexibility beyond MPL-2.0

---

## When You DON'T Need a Commercial License

You can use HiWave under MPL-2.0 (free) if:

- You use HiWave as-is without modifying its source files
- You modify HiWave and are willing to share those modifications under MPL-2.0
- You're using HiWave for personal, educational, or internal purposes
- You're building on top of HiWave (your own code can remain proprietary under MPL-2.0)
